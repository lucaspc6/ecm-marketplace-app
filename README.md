# ECM Marketplace - QA Automation Test App

A minimal web application designed for QA automation practice with Selenium, Playwright, or similar testing frameworks.

## Purpose

This application serves as an Application Under Test (AUT) for practicing UI automation. It includes:
- Intentional async delays to practice explicit waits
- localStorage-based authentication and cart management
- Stable element IDs for reliable test locators
- Multiple user flows for comprehensive test scenarios

## How to Run

### Option 1: Node.js Server (Recommended)

1. Install dependencies (none required, but run for future compatibility):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Option 2: Python Simple Server (Alternative)

1. Navigate to the app directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. Start Python's built-in HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

## Test Automation Notes

### Intentional Delays (Explicit Waits Required)

The application includes intentional delays to simulate real-world async operations:
- **Login**: 600ms delay after clicking login button
- **Product Search**: 400ms delay after typing in search field
- **Checkout**: 500ms delay after clicking complete order button

**Important**: Your tests must use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium, `waitFor` in Playwright) to handle these delays properly.

### localStorage Keys

The application uses browser localStorage for state management:
- `auth`: String value `'true'` when user is authenticated
- `cart`: JSON array of product objects added to cart

### Element Locators

All interactive elements have stable IDs for reliable test automation:

**Navigation (index.html)**:
- `#nav-login` - Link to login page
- `#nav-products` - Link to products page
- `#nav-checkout` - Link to checkout page

**Login Page (login.html)**:
- `#username` - Username input field
- `#password` - Password input field
- `#btnLogin` - Login button
- `#msg` - Status message container (role="alert")

**Products Page (products.html)**:
- `#q` - Search input field
- `#tbl-products` - Products table
- `#tbody` - Table body with product rows
- `.btn-add` - Add to cart buttons (with `data-id` attribute)
- `#cart-count` - Cart item count display

**Checkout Page (checkout.html)**:
- `#tbl-cart` - Cart items table
- `#tbody` - Table body with cart items
- `#total` - Total price display
- `#btnFinish` - Complete order button
- `#msg` - Status message container (role="status")

### Test Credentials

- **Username**: `valid_user`
- **Password**: `secret123`

### Product Database

The application has 5 fixed products:
1. Keyboard - R$120.90
2. Mouse - R$79.50
3. Monitor - R$1299.00
4. Headset - R$240.00
5. Webcam - R$320.00

### Suggested Page Object Model (POM)

Consider creating these page classes:
- `LoginPage` - Handle login operations
- `ProductsPage` - Handle product search and cart operations
- `CheckoutPage` - Handle checkout and order completion

### Example Test Flows

1. **Successful Login Flow**:
   - Navigate to login page
   - Enter valid credentials
   - Click login button
   - Wait for success message (600ms delay)
   - Verify redirect to products page

2. **Failed Login Flow**:
   - Navigate to login page
   - Enter invalid credentials
   - Click login button
   - Wait for error message (600ms delay)
   - Verify error message displayed

3. **Product Search Flow**:
   - Navigate to products page
   - Enter search term in search field
   - Wait for filtered results (400ms delay)
   - Verify correct products displayed

4. **Add to Cart Flow**:
   - Navigate to products page
   - Click "Add to Cart" for a product
   - Verify cart count increases
   - Verify localStorage cart updated

5. **Authenticated Checkout Flow**:
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Add products to cart
   - Navigate to checkout page
   - Click "Complete Order"
   - Wait for success message (500ms delay)
   - Verify order placed and cart cleared

6. **Unauthenticated Checkout Flow**:
   - Clear localStorage (logout)
   - Add products to cart
   - Navigate to checkout page
   - Click "Complete Order"
   - Wait for error message (500ms delay)
   - Verify authentication error displayed

## Browser Compatibility

This application is compatible with modern browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium (recommended for automation)
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

## Notes for Test Automation Engineers

- All pages use semantic HTML for better accessibility and testability
- JavaScript is embedded in HTML files for simplicity
- No external dependencies or frameworks required
- The application is stateless on the server side (all state in localStorage)
- Perfect for practicing explicit waits, POM patterns, and data-driven testing
- Can be used with any UI automation framework (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, etc.)
